# MaryvilleWebAppSoftwareFinalProject
Final project for Master's degree course at Maryville for software development degree.

# Project Idea
The main purpose of this project is to develop a web application that incorporates three main componenets: user interface, database, and service layers to communicate data between the database and user interface. I will be designing, developing, testing, and deploying my own application. The goal is that demonstrating these completed components will show a mastery of our abilities to developer a software artifact.
